sublime-debian 1.0.0
--------------------

Thank you for installing sublime-debian, a Debian packaging file syntax
highlighter for Sublime Text.

You're almost there, you'll only need to close and reopen all Debian related
files (debian/changelog, debian/control, ...) or restart Sublime Text.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, bugs, or patches, please open an
issue or pull request over on GitHub (https://github.com/barnumbirr/sublime-debian).
You can also find me on Twitter @barnumbirr.
